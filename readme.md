# m27qlib

This library provides functions to control Gigabyte M27Q monitors.

I made this to compile to a dll so I can use it with an AutoHotKey script.

I'm currently learning C++ so I really don't know if what I'm doing is "right".

Big thanks to P403n1x87. Without his Python M27Q controller script (https://github.com/P403n1x87/m27q) as a base this library wouldn't be possible.
